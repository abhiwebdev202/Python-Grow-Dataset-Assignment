# Python-Grow-Dataset-Assignment
Plotting the Grow Dataset of GROW Sensors in the United Kingdom on a UK Map Image

The bounding box for the map is as follows:
•	Longitude Min -10.592
•	Longitude Max 1.6848
•	Latitude Min 50.681
•	Latitude Max 57.985

The Provided files for the assignment:

•	The Grow dataset Growlocations.csv.  This file contains the locations of all the GROW sensors as Latitude and Longitude
•	A map of the UK from Openstreet map.

This Python program can read the dataset into a dataframe and plot the locations of the sensors on the map provided. Tutorial used for reference is "freecodecamp.org"s 'Data Analysis with Python Course', which teaches us the basics of pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries of Python.
